<b>Description:</b> Multiple variable regression implementation. In this practice, we will work with one dataset that created by ourself. The target is 
Stock_Index_Price (This is our dependent variable). The value of target is depending on two other variables as Interest_Rate and Unemployment_Rate.
These are our features or independent variables. There is a linear relationship (correlation) between independent variable and dependent variable.
Thus we define one linear regression model to estimate the output for new data. At the end we defined manually two new data and we estimate the 
related output. Also we compare our model output with statsmodel.
